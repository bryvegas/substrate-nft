# Substrate !ink NFT simple implementation
***
This is a simple working version of base NFT smart contract written using latest (as of this date) !ink `3.0.0-rc3`.

To run all tests:
``` 
cargo +nightly test
```
To compile to WASM:
``` 
cargo +nightly contract build 
```
Original wasm size: 47.4K, Optimized: 26.3K

Once your contract is compiled you can find artifacts in:
<PROJECT_DIR>/target/ink

- nft.contract (code + metadata)
- nft.wasm (the contract's code)
- metadata.json (the contract's metadata)

If you are facing any issues please follow the setup step of substrate environment at:

## Testing on using Polk4 canvas network
***
You can upload this contract and interract with it either via your own local Canvas node or using Polk4 Canvas testnet.
